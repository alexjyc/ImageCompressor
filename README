Architecture
- 40image.c
  This is a file where it takes an option to  -c (for compress) or -d 
  (for decompress) and also the name of the file to compress or decompress.
- a2blocked.c
  This is a file where it defines a private version of each function in 
  A2Methods_T that we implement
- a2plain.c
  This is a file where it defines a private version of each function in 
  A2Methods_T that we implement
- bitpack.c
  This is a file where it packs, unpacks, and changes bit structure of 64 bit
  word.
- compress40.c
  This is a file where it has compress40 and decompress function is implemented
- formulas.c
  This is a file where it has implemantation of all the math function that
  used for the compression and the decompression.
- formulas.h
  The interface of formulas class
- io.c
  This is a file where it
- io.h
  The interface of io class
- ppmdiff.c
  This is a file where it open the file and check the difference between the
  two ppm images.
- transform.c
  This is a file where it implements the function that used to compression and
  decompression of images.
- transform.h
  The interface of transform class
- uarray2.c
  This is a file where it implements uarray2 function
- uarray2.h
  The interface of uarray2 class
- uarray2b.c
  This is a file where it implements uarray2b function
- uarray2b.h
  The interface of uarray2b class
